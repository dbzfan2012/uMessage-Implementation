# uMessage Implementation

Implemented data structures like a Min Four Heap, a LinkedList where items are added to the front, a Circular Array FIFO Queue, an AVL Tree, and a Chaining Hash Table
Additionally, implemented sorting algorithms HeapSort, QuickSort, and TopKSort

Finally, used these data structures and sorting algorithms to implement uMessage, a program which connects to a live server and allows you to have a conversation with other people also connected to uMessage. 
Using the data structures and different types of corpuses, the uMessage application has an auto-complete feature as you are writing text, giving you the next 3 most-likely tokens which you can input instead of typing out a message.
